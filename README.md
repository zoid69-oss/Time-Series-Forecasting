Forecasting Nifty50 Stock Prices Using the ARIMA Model


During this period, I worked on forecasting the Nifty50 stock index prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. This project demonstrated my ability to employ statistical techniques for financial market analysis.

Highlights:

Data Collection: Extracted historical Nifty50 price data using the Yahoo Finance API.
Model Optimization: Applied the auto_arima feature from the pmdarima library to fine-tune model parameters, ensuring higher predictive accuracy.
Trading Strategy: Developed a trading approach based on the model's predictions, achieving a 22% return with a minimal 5% drawdown, outperforming a simple buy-and-hold strategy.
Performance Metrics: Attained a Sharpe ratio of over 2, signifying strong risk-adjusted returns compared to market benchmarks.
This project highlights my proficiency in financial analytics and statistical modeling while emphasizing my ability to transform data-driven insights into practical trading strategies.

Technologies Used: Python, ARIMA, pmdarima, Yahoo Finance API, Jupyter Notebook
